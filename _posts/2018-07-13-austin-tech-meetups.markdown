Hello,

As I find myself in a new city (Berlin!!!), I thought I'd write this post for my fellow techies looking to get involved in the tech scene in Austin.

Here's a quick rundown of awesome Meetups to join if you're new to Austin or looking to get involved in the tech community:

[Women Who Code]( http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Austin/) - Women Who Code is an amazing organization that's worldwide and the very first Meetup I ever attended. Typically there are weekly Meetups focusing on different topics, check them out on the Meetup page! I've met an plethora of amazing women through this organization and have been an organizer for the Tech Talks! Highly recommend WWC, especially for you ladies looking to get into tech, you'll find a wonderful support group.

[Refresh Austin](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-Web-Design/) - Yet another superb organization, Refresh Austin focuses on all things tech, hosts great speakers and save time at the beginning of the monthly Meetup for those looking for work and those looking to hire.

[Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/) - If you want to contribute to open source projects or feel like using your tech skills to benefit the city, then join Open Austin! You'll find tons of amazing people looking for help with their projects benefiting the community. Open Source + community focused projects FTW!

[Fresh2Design](https://www.meetup.com/fresh2design/) - For the more design focused individuals, this group offers passionate UX/UI Designers and budding Designers to share their knowledge with engaging talks and fun happy hours.


Hope this list is of use to you, there are many more Meetups and groups to be a part of, but the above are some of my favorite!
