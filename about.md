Developer/Polyglot/Optimist

As a lifelong student, I enjoy learning a variety of topics and acquiring new skills. As an organizer with Women Who Code, I aim to help boost diversity in tech.

I'm particularly fond of Front-End Web Development and making an effort to familiarize myself with JS frameworks, but happily proficient with good old HTML/CSS/JS.

The penchant to learn languages, both formal and natural ones, is one of the greatest joys in my life. I was fortunate to have been raised in the border city of El Paso, TX where I grew up speaking both English and Spanish. My academic pursuits led me to study in Germany for a year, where to this day native German speakers commend me for my fluency in Deutsch.

Â¡Espero que logremos trabajar juntos! Freue mich auf jede Nachricht!
